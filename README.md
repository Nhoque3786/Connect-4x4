# Connect 4²
(AKA Connect 4 Times 4)
My first game using *Haxeflixel!*

I'm Learning how to use this on my own, so expect some bugs and really ugly code. (or no code at all on the early stages, lol)

## About:
Connect 4² it's a simple game of connect 4, but everything is times four. There's 8 players, and the size of the board is enourmous. What could possibly go wrong?

There's also Classic (the normal connect 4 that everyone loves, or hates), times 2 and times 3 If you wanna start small.
